This is an unoffical web version of Adobe's official specification of Adobe™ Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF), Version 2.2, published on 22 March 1993.

I made the unoffical web version because it could be easier to read, search and link to than the PDF version. The original "Examples" chapiter has some errors, which I fixed.

:::note

Adobe holds the copyright of the BDF specification. You can find the original PDF file of the specification — including the Copyright Notice and the Appendix — [here](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5005.BDF_Spec.pdf).

The unoffical web version is not for profit, purely for educational purposes, and used within the scope of the "fair use" doctrine.
